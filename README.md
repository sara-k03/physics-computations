### Homework 8: 
The only question in this folder is Question #17 from Section 8.2 of Modern Physics by Felder & Felder. 
## Granular Materials & Networks Lab 
### Instron-Machine-Data-Analysis
Contains datasets/analysis for data obtained from the Instron machine when compressing disordered network cubes. Methods currently being modified.
### Point-Cloud-Modeling
# Point Cloud Modeling
Current directions to generate point cloud from .pcd file: 
- Click on pcd_analysis.py 
- If you want generate a model for the only pcd file that's currently in Datasets, leave the code as it is. 
- Otherwise, change the file pathname on line 7 to use the data set that you want.
